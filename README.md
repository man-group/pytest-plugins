## Developing these plugins

All of these plugins share setup code and configuration so there is a top-level Makefile to
automate process of setting them up for test and development.

### Pre-requisites

You have `python` installed on your path as well as `virtualenv`

### Makefile targets

To create a local virtualenv called `venv`, install all extra dependencies and set up all
of the packages for development simply run:

```bash
    make develop
```

To do this for a subset of packages run:

```bash
    make develop PACKAGES="pytest-profiling pytest-devpi"
```

If you already have a virtualenv and would rather just use that, you can run this to 
copy all the required files in place and setup up all the packages using that:

```bash
    make local_develop
```
